PLAYFUL SOMETHING
====

### DUE: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12

In his paper *The Art of Interaction: Interactivity, Performativity, and Computers* (found in the `Readings` folder), David Saltz describes interactive art having three things: 

* An input device that translates one's behavior into digital form  
* That the input data affects the output  
* And that the output is translated back into real-world phenomena that we can perceive, all in real-time  

This week, your assignment is to build a "playful experience" that is interactive in some way, responding to mouse and/or keyboard input in a visual way. It can be a one or multi-player visual game, or a visual story involves user interaction. How you approach this, and what it looks like, is up to you, but the result should be a unique exploration of interactivity and the visual.

HAVING FUN IS MANDATORY!

Think about ways the mouse and keyboard could change:

* Position (stillness/motion, follow the mouse or flee away, move back-and-forth)  
* Size (things get bigger, smaller, appear, disappear)  
* Shape (number of sides, switch between shapes)  
* Rotation (angle, faster/slower, start/stop)  
* Color (shift or flicker, `lerpColor()`, HSB mode)  
* How many of something (end condition of for-loop or recursion)  
* Complex conditions (nest if/else statements depending on interaction)  
* Constraining movement or changes using `map()`  

Remember! The way your finished code interacts with the viewer and the visual results it creates are what's important: fancy code + boring output = boring art. Same goes for ["feature creep"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) (aka the potpourri approach). 

In addition to the sketch's interactive functionality, please add a way to export still images (perhaps a key or combination of keys, saved with a timestamp) or record your screen (very easy on macs). Save at least three images of your sketch and include in your upload.

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* How can you combine the keyboard and mouse for more complex, rich interaction? Could the basic drawing tool be modified by the keyboard in some way?  
* Can you document your sketch and create a Github repository for it as an open source project?  

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
* Your project should use interactivity through mouse and/or keyboard input to create a unique visual experience  
* Name your sketch `LastnameFirstname_Interactivity`  
* Your sketch can be any size, but think about how that changes our experience of it  
* Add a means of saving images of your sketch running and output at least two images of it running  
* Zip your sketch, with the images inside, and upload to Canvas before the start of class  
* Write up a response to this week's readings (info below)


### RESOURCES  
* If you want more natural movement, you might find the `Math` examples (under `File > Examples...`) to be helpful, especially ones like `Sine`, as well as `Interaction` and `Motion`  
* [Read more about A. Michael Noll's work](http://median.newmediacaucus.org/routing-mondrian-the-a-michael-noll-experiment/) in the Media-N journal  
* Several articles on the history of interactivity and the arts in this week's `Resources/ Readings` folder

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
